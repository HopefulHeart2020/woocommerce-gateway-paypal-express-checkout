"Internally, WC calculates line item prices and taxes out to four decimal "
"places; however, PayPal can only handle amounts out to two decimal places "
"(or, depending on the currency, no decimal places at all). Occasionally, "
"this can cause discrepancies between the way WooCommerce calculates prices "
"versus the way PayPal calculates them. If a mismatch occurs, this option "
"controls how the order is dealt with so payment can still be taken."
